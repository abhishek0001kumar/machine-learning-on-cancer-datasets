# machine-learning-on-cancer-datasets

Application of various classifiers and algorithms on cancer datasets using scikit-learn. First applying algorithms with default parameters 
and then changing the parameters to find better accuracy .
some of the algorithms used are as follows:-
1)KNN
2)LOGISTIC REGRESSION
3)DECISION TREE
4)RANDOM FOREST
5)NEURAL NETWORK
6)SVM
